From a mathematical and physical point of view, wave propagation phenomena or rather the way we describe them are independent of scale. In principle this means that methods developed for instance in geophysics where we are interested to image large subsurface structures may as well be applied to a small scale application as in medical ultrasound. This ability to translate imaging methods rests on the fact that considering common frequencies and material properties, the kinematic and dynamic scaling properties are very similar in exploration geophysics and medical ultrasound (for a detailed comparison see the paper by Pratt [1]). 
I have been involved in translating imaging methods from seismics to medical ultrasound for some time now. One major project was to apply the interferometry concept [2][3] extensively used for passive seismic imaging with noise sources to setups used for breast cancer screening with ultrasound computed tomography [4][5]. These setups commonly use a 2D ring aperture with transducers (ultrasonic sources and receivers) mounted on the ring. This allows to enclose the breast from all sides, which is from a geophysical point of view a very ideal imaging setup (considering that for the common exploration geophysical imaging setup, we cannot enclose our targed, i.e. a part of the subsurface with sources and receivers).
