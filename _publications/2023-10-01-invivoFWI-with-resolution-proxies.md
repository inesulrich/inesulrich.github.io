title: "Full-waveform inversion with resolution proxies for in-vivo ultrasound computed tomography"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-10-01-invivoFWI-with-resolution-proxies
excerpt: 'This paper presents an in-vivo application of full-waveform inversion (FWI) to medical ultrasound data, reconstructing a cross-sectional slice through a mouse's abdomen. The goal of this study was to push the boundaries of high-resolution FWI for small-scale medical applications. To underline the accuracy of the reconstructed tissue models, we also provide a resolution analysis based on point-spread functions that provides a baseline for an uncertainty quantification, which is essential to accurately interpret reconstructed tissue and anatomical features in a post-processing step.

This paper presents an in-vivo application of full-waveform inversion (FWI) to medical ultrasound data, reconstructing a cross-sectional slice through a mouse's abdomen. The goal of this study was to push the boundaries of high-resolution FWI for small-scale medical applications. To underline the accuracy of the reconstructed tissue models, we also provide a resolution analysis based on point-spread functions that provides a baseline for an uncertainty quantification, which is essential to accurately interpret reconstructed tissue and anatomical features in a post-processing step. The data was collected from living mice by the from the University of Zurich and parts of the data set are publicly available on.
