title: "Waveform inversion with calibrated source-time functions for improving in-vivo ultrasound computed tomography"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-06-01-invivoFWI_with_calibrated_source_time_functions
excerpt: 'This paper is a follow up to our [first in-vivo full-waveform paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308297), demonstrating that by increasing the accuracy of the source-time function that drives ultrasonic wave propagation in the simulation, we are able to increase the resolution of reconstructed features significantly. The source-time functions have thereby been calibrated individually per transducer by an additional source inversion that matches the recorded first arrival waveforms from a reference water shot to the measured data. Including the source inversion within the presented workflow is rather straight forward and therefore the expectation is that ultrasound computed tomography applications would generally benefit form such a calibration step.

This paper is a follow up to our [first in-vivo full-waveform paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308297), demonstrating that by increasing the accuracy of the source-time function that drives ultrasonic wave propagation in the simulation, we are able to increase the resolution of reconstructed features significantly. The source-time functions have thereby been calibrated individually per transducer by an additional source inversion that matches the recorded first arrival waveforms from a reference water shot to the measured data. Including the source inversion within the presented workflow is rather straight forward and therefore the expectation is that ultrasound computed tomography applications would generally benefit form such a calibration step.  

As previously, the data was collected from living mice by the [Razansky lab](https://www.razanskylab.org/) from the University of Zurich and parts of the data set are publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/berkanlafci/pyruct).
