excerpt: 'Here, we investigate the possibility to apply the interferometic imaging principle developed in seismics to medical ultrasound for breast cancer screening. This paper shows some preliminary results, which are extended to a more rigorous basis in the paper _Diffuse ultrasound computed tomography_.'
