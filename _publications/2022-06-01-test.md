title: "Full-waveform inversion with resolution proxies for in-vivo ultrasound computed tomography"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-06-01-test
excerpt: 'This paper presents an in-vivo application of full-waveform inversion (FWI) to medical ultrasound data, reconstructing a cross-sectional slice through a mouse's abdomen. The goal of this study was to push the boundaries of high-resolution FWI for small-scale medical applications. To underline the accuracy of the reconstructed tissue models, we also provide a resolution analysis based on point-spread functions that provides a baseline for an uncertainty quantification, which is essential to accurately interpret reconstructed tissue and anatomical features in a post-processing step.

Test 

As previously, the data was collected from living mice by the [Razansky lab](https://www.razanskylab.org/) from the University of Zurich and parts of the data set are publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/berkanlafci/pyruct).
